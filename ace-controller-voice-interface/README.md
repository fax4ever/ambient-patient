In this example, we showcase how to build a patient front desk voice agent pipeline using WebRTC with real-time transcripts. It uses Pipecat pipeline with FastAPI on the backend, and React on the frontend. This pipeline uses a WebRTC based SmallWebRTCTransport, Riva ASR and TTS models and an Agent service. An example recording of the agent interaction with audio can be found [here](./assets/agentic_front_desk_patient_intake.mp4).


## Prerequisites
### Hardware Requirements
For the hardware required when choosing to self deploy the RIVA ASR and TTS NIMs, please see the details on the RIVA NIMs in the [ambient-patient/README](../README.md#hardware-requirements).

### API Keys
- NVIDIA AI Enterprise developer licence required to local host NVIDIA NIM Microservices.
- [NVIDIA API Key](https://build.nvidia.com/) for access to hosted NVIDIA NIM Microservices on the public NVIDIA AI Endpoints. See [NVIDIA API Keys](../docs/api_keys.md#nvidia-api-key) for detailed steps.
- [NGC API Key](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/latest/ngc-private-registry-user-guide.html#ngc-api-keys) for NGC container download and resources.


### Software

- Linux operating systems (Ubuntu 22.04 or later recommended)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)



## Setup API keys and Configure Service Settings


Open the [ace_controller.env](./ace_controller.env) file, and configure the following environment variables:
  - `NGC_API_KEY` - Required for downloading RIVA ASR and TTS NIMs (containers on NGC) for self hosting.
  - `NVIDIA_API_KEY` - Required to access the NVIDIA API catalog public endpoints [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/) if utilizing public endpoints for the RIVA ASR AND TTS NIMs.
  - `CONFIG_PATH` - required configuration file for the speech pipeline.
    - Option 1: when utilizing the public NVIDIA AI Endpoints for the RIVA ASR and TTS NIMs, specify `CONFIG_PATH=./configs/config_riva_public_endpoints.yaml` 
    - Option 2: when self hosting the RIVA ASR NIM, specify `CONFIG_PATH=./configs/config_riva_self_hosting.yaml`
  
    See [Bot Pipeline Customizations](#pipeline-customizations) for more info.
  - `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` - this specifies the timeout threshold in seconds waiting for a response from the request to the agent backend
   
## Deploy Services

There are multiple service components in the agentic patient front desk assistant application, all of which are deployed through Docker Compose.

1. Riva Parakeet ASR Service (optional for local self hosting)
2. Riva Magpie TTS Service (optional for local self hosting)
3. Agentic Patient Front Desk Service
4. The Speech Service
5. The UI Service

Key components of the services are configured as environment variables in the `ace_controller.env` file and as configuration parameters under `configs/config_*.yaml` before deploying the application. 

### Bring up the RIVA ASR and TTS NIMs
If you decided to utilize the public endpoints for the RIVA ASR AND TTS NIMs, and have set `CONFIG_PATH=./configs/config_riva_public_endpoints.yaml` in your `ace_controller.env` file, skip this step. 

If you decided to self host the RIVA ASR AND TTS NIMs, and have set `CONFIG_PATH=./configs/config_riva_self_hosting.yaml` in your `ace_controller.env` file, stand up the RIVA NIMs now with the commands:
```bash
docker compose up -d riva-asr-parakeet
docker compose up -d riva-tts-magpie
```
Note: It could take up to 6 minutes for the status of the NIM containers to change from starting to healthy.

### Bring up the RIVA Speech Service and UI 

```bash
docker compose --profile ace-controller up --build -d 
```

Note: To enable microphone access in Chrome, go to `chrome://flags/`, enable "Insecure origins treated as secure", add `http://<machine-ip>:4400` to the list, and restart Chrome.



## Using Coturn Server

If you want to share widely or want to deploy on cloud platforms, you will need to setup coturn server. Follow instructions in section `5. Set up Coturn Server` in the [ace-controller/examples/voice_agent_webrtc](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ace-controller/tree/develop/examples/voice_agent_webrtc#steps-to-deploy-voice_agent_webrtc-application) README for modifications required for using coturn.

## Pipeline Customizations

### Configuring ASR and TTS Models

You may customize ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) services by configuring the `config_*.yaml` files in [configs/](./configs/). 

The choice between the two .yaml files as-is allows you to switch between NIM public endpoints hosted models and locally deployed models:

- When `CONFIG_PATH=./configs/config_riva_public_endpoints.yaml` is specified, the yaml file as-is sets the following: 
  - `RivaASRService.server="grpc.nvcf.nvidia.com:443"`
  - `RivaASRService.function_id="1598d209-5e27-4d3c-8079-4751568b1081"`
  - `RivaTTSService.server="grpc.nvcf.nvidia.com:443"`
  - `RivaTTSService.function_id="877104f7-e885-42b9-8de8-f6e4c6303969"`

- When `CONFIG_PATH=./configs/config_riva_self_hosting.yaml` is specified, the yaml file as-is sets the following: 
  - `RivaASRService.server="riva-asr-parakeet:50052"`
  - `RivaASRService.model="parakeet-1.1b-en-US-asr-streaming-silero-vad-sortformer"`
  - `RivaTTSService.server="riva-tts-magpie:50051"`
  - `RivaTTSService.model="magpie_tts_ensemble-Magpie-Multilingual"`

For more details on configuration options, such as `language` options for ASR/TTS, `sample_rate` for ASR, `voice_id` options for TTS, refer to the [NIM NVIDIA Magpie](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/magpie-tts-multilingual), [NIM NVIDIA Parakeet](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/parakeet-ctc-1_1b-asr/api) documentation.


You could change the ASR / TTS models to different ones if you'd like. Browse [build.nvidia.com](build.nvidia.com) for the available ASR/TTS NIMs. You could find the `function_id` for each model in the example requests under the `Try API` tab on build.nvidia.com, such as https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/magpie-tts-multilingual/api.

### Adding Custom TTS IPA Dictionary
In [ipa.json](./ipa.json), you could add to the dictionary your custom word-pronounciation pairs in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) standard.
