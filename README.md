# Ambient Healthcare Agent for Patients
## Overview
An agentic healthcare front desk can assist patients and healthcare professional staff by reducing the burden of the patient intake process, structuring responses into documentation and thus allowing for more patient-clinical staff quality time. This developer example provides developers with a reference implementation of an voice agent powered by NVIDIA LLM NIM, NVIDIA RIVA ASR and TTS NIM, and NeMo Guardrails. It includes a demonstration of the agent's capabilities in a typical conversation between a patient and a healthcare clinical staff member.

## Key Features
- **Patient Intake Agent**: An agent follows a system prompt script to guide a patient through the intake process at a clinic.
- **Other agent examples**: Additional examples of an appointment making agent, medication information agent, and a full agent that combines the 3 specialized agents.
- **NeMo Guardrails**: utilizing NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails for added safety to the agent's interactions with the patients.
- **Interaction via Voice or Chatbot**: voice interactions powered by NVIDIA Riva ASR and TTS  orchestrated by NVIDIA ACE Controller SDK. A text-based chatbot is also available as a Gradio UI.


## Target Audience
- Developers: This developer example serves as a reference architecture for teams to create their own healthcare agents that interact with patients.

## Software Components
The Ambient Patient developer example provides the following software components:

- **Agents**: Implemented in LangGraph, these agents provide an example implementation of utilizing LLMs with tool calling capabilities, creating tools for various healthcare purposes, utilizing the system prompt of the agent to guide agent behavior, and optionally adding guardrails to the LLM. We will mainly focus on the patient intake agent, but there are three other agents available as well. Please see [agent/](./agent/) for more details. The agents are implemented in the graph_*.py files in [agent/graph_definitions/](./agent/graph_definitions). 

- **NeMo Guardrails**: Safeguards your agentic application and provides highly customizable configurations. Please see [NeMo Guardrails](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-guardrails) for more details.

- **Voice UI Frontend**: The voice UI powered by the **NVIDIA ACE Controller SDK** utilizes WebRTC for connection. In the technical diagram, this includes the Web Client component, ACE Controller component, and the RIVA ASR and TTS NIMs. Please see [ace-controller-voice-interface/](./ace-controller-voice-interface/) for more details.

- **FastAPI Server**: The agents are served to the voice UI via a FastAPI server. Please see [agent/](./agent/chain_server/) for more details.

The Ambient Patient developer example has the following software dependencies:
- [NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-guardrails)
- [NVIDIA ACE Controller SDK](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ace-controller/tree/develop)
- [NVIDIA RIVA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/riva/) for automatic speech recognition and text to speech capabilities in the voice UI. 
- [NVIDIA NIM](https://developer.nvidia.com/nim) for powering the agent LLM, NeMo Guardrails LLM, and RIVA ASR and TTS.

## Hardware Requirements

### Scenario 1:  For running with hosted NVIDIA NIM Microservices

This blueprint can be run entirely with hosted NVIDIA NIM Microservices without local NIM deployments. See [https://build.nvidia.com/](https://build.nvidia.com/) for details on each NIM. For this case, no GPU is required.

While it can be run without local NIM deployments, we recommend deploying the RIVA ASR and TTS NIMs locally. For this case, please see the modelcards linked below for the GPU requirement.

### Scenario 2: For running all services locally 
#### Disk Space
The disk space required in this scenario is 300 GB.
#### GPU Requirement
