# Deployment Using Public NVIDIA AI Endpoints
## Prerequisite
### Log in to NGC
```sh
docker login nvcr.io
Username: $oauthtoken
Password: < your private NGC key here >
```
You should see `Login Succeeded`.

## Deployment Steps
We will bring up the services in this developer example via docker compose.

### 1. Set Environment Variables for Agent Backend
Read through this section [1. Edit the vars.env file to set environment variables](../agent/README.md#1-edit-the-varsenv-file-to-set-environment-variables) in the agent/README to configure each of the environment variables needed in [agent/vars.env](../agent/vars.env) for bringing up the agent backend.

Since we are utilizing the public NVIDIA AI Endpoints for experiencing the developer example for the first time, leave the default values for:
- `AGENT_LLM_BASE_URL="https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1"`
- If you would like NemoGuard NIMs enabled: `NEMO_GUARDRAILS_CONFIG_PATH=nmgr-config-store/patient-intake-nemoguard`

### 2. Deploy Agent Backend App Server

 We will be bringing up the `app-server` service in [agent/docker-compose.yaml](../agent/docker-compose.yaml)
 ```sh
 # navigate to ambient-patient
 cd <path to your ambient-patient dir>
 ```
 ```sh
 docker compose -f agent/docker-compose.yaml up --build app-server
 # or to detach from docker logs add -d:
 docker compose -f agent/docker-compose.yaml up --build -d app-server
 ```
The build should take a few minutes. Note that after building the image for the first time, for bringing up this service again, if nothing in the source files changes and you don't need to rebuild the image, you could remove `--build` from the command:

```sh
docker compose -f agent/docker-compose.yaml up -d app-server
```

Run the following command that refreshes every 2 seconds in a seperate terminal tab to view the container that we have just brought up
```sh
watch -n 2 'docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}"'
```
You should see a name `app-server-healthcare-assistant` in the results, for example:
```
NAMES                             IMAGE                                    STATUS
app-server-healthcare-assistant   app-server-healthcare-assistant:latest   Up 18 seconds
```
### 3. Set Environment Variables for the ace-controller Voice UI

Navigate to the [`ace-controller-voice-interface`](../ace-controller-voice-interface/) directory. Follow this section [Setup API Keys and Configure Service Settings](../ace-controller-voice-interface/README.md#setup-api-keys-and-configure-service-settings) in the ace-controller-voice-interface/README and set the variables in  [`ace-controller-voice-interface/ace_controller.env`](../ace-controller-voice-interface/ace_controller.env).

- Set your API Keys
- Since we're utilizing the public NVIDIA AI Endpoints, we should keep the default `CONFIG_PATH`:
    ```sh
    CONFIG_PATH=./configs/config_riva_public_endpoints.yaml
    ```

### 4. Deploy Voice UI Powered by ace-controller
**Note before proceeding!** When deploying on cloud providers such as Brev, a Turn server is needed. A Turn server is needed for WebRTC connections when clients are behind NATs or firewalls that prevent direct peer-to-peer communication. Please see the [Turn Server](./turn-server.md) documentation on setting one up before proceeding with the Voice UI powered by ace-controller.

 ```sh
 # make sure you're in the directory ambient-patient
 cd <path to your ambient-patient dir>
 ```
```bash
docker compose --profile ace-controller -f ace-controller-voice-interface/docker-compose.yml up --build
# or to detach from docker logs add -d:
docker compose --profile ace-controller -f ace-controller-voice-interface/docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```
The build should take a few minutes. Remove `--build` from the command if you haven't change any sources files and are bringing up the services again:
```sh
docker compose --profile ace-controller -f ace-controller-voice-interface/docker-compose.yml up -d
```
You should see the new names `voice-agents-webrtc-ui-app-1` and `voice-agents-webrtc-python-app-1` in the docker ps results, for example:

```sh
NAMES                              IMAGE                                    STATUS
voice-agents-webrtc-ui-app-1       voice-agents-webrtc-ui-app               Up About a minute
voice-agents-webrtc-python-app-1   voice-agents-webrtc-python-app           Up About a minute (healthy)
app-server-healthcare-assistant    app-server-healthcare-assistant:latest   Up 5 minutes
```
### 5. Go to the Voice UI in your Web Browser
First, to enable microphone access in Chrome, go to `chrome://flags/`, enable "Insecure origins treated as secure", add `http://<machine-ip>:4400` to the list, and restart Chrome.

Next, go to `http://<machine-ip>:4400` in your browser to visit the voice UI. Upon loading, the page should look like the following:

### 6. Bring down the services
Bring down the app server that serves the agent
```sh
docker compose -f agent/docker-compose.yaml down app-server
```
Bring down the ace-controller web UI
```sh
docker compose --profile ace-controller -f ace-controller-voice-interface/docker-compose.yml down
```
